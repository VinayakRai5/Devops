📦 CI/CD Pipeline Design
The CI/CD pipeline is designed for maximum efficiency with full automation of build, test, and deployment processes.

CI/CD Flow:
Code Commit ➡️ Build ➡️ Test ➡️ Deploy
Automated Testing using unit, integration, and e2e test suites.
Blue/Green and Rolling deployments for zero-downtime releases.

🏗️ Infrastructure Components
Network: VPC, Subnets, Security Groups.
Compute: EC2, Lambda.
Storage: S3, EBS, RDS.
Monitoring: CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana.
Security: IAM Roles, Policies, Secrets Manager.

📊 Monitoring & Logging
Prometheus for metrics collection.
Grafana for real-time dashboards.
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and analytics.
